    <h2>Toucan is a non-profit organization working hard to provide free music lessons for less privileged children. Our goal is to make music education accessible, enjoyable for kids, and helping these kids discover joy in music.
      Toucan was initiated by a group of friends who recognized the high cost of music education as a significant barrier for many families. Our mission is to bridge the gap by offering free music lessons. Music is something that brings happiness and different people together, and Toucan’s goal is to be able to bring that to kids who don’t have access to that.
